we will understand oop

## What is oop:
it is a modern approach to give a proper structure to a code ,to standardize the code,it helps in reducing unnecessary space.
Js does'nt have inbuilt Classes but it got prototype

what is object=>Collection of properties(variables) and methods(functions)

some keywords we will hear a lot=>
Constructer(),
new keyowrd,this keyword
prototype
classes
Object Literal

## 4 pillars of oop
Abstraction(concept of hiding the background work)
Encapsulation(concept of wrapping the data)
polymorphism(concept of using the properties diffrently multiple times)
inheritance(concept of inheriting properties and methods)

### Everything in js is a object######################
